# chat-form

* like there is a sign-up form and we want user to fill it via a chat-window towards server-bot.

example:
  * as soon as user clicks on sign-up
  * s/he will face a chat-window with first question
  * 'your good name? please!'
  * user will type in chat-response and hit 'enter'
  * server will receive, parse, evaluate, accept(or not) and send next question.
  * 'what's your date of birth?'
  * so on...
  * At-last 'you wanna submit? **Y**es|y|Y or **N**o|n|N'
